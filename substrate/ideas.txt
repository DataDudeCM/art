Playing with Color and Light
Right now, we have a monochrome world. Color is a huge opportunity to add another layer of data visualization to the piece.

Generational Color: What if the color of each branch was determined by its generation? The main trunk could be a warm red, its children a slightly cooler orange, their children yellow, and so on, moving through the spectrum. You'd end up with a visual map of the system's hierarchy.
Directional Color: The color could reflect the direction of travel. Lines moving right could be tinted blue, left red, up green, down yellow. The result would be these beautiful, subtle color fields that emerge from the chaos.
Pulsing Light: Instead of the glow just fading out, what if it pulsed? We could tie its alpha to a sine wave (sin()). The entire structure would appear to breathe or have a subtle, shimmering energy.
2. Introducing Organic Movement
The current system is very geometric. We could make it feel more natural and less "on the grid."

The "Wobble": Instead of moving in a perfectly straight line, we could add a tiny bit of Perlin noise (p.noise()) to each walker's direction on every frame. This would introduce a gentle, organic "wobble," making the lines feel more like vines, neurons, or river deltas. You could even add another slider to control the "wobble amount."
Environmental Forces: Imagine an invisible "flow field" or "wind" blowing across the canvas (also generated with Perlin noise). Each walker would be slightly "pushed" by the force at its current position. This would make the entire structure seem to grow in response to its environment, like seaweed in an ocean current.
3. Making it React to Data (The Big Idea)
This one feels especially connected to your unique blend of skills—bridging the gap between data, photography, and creative code.

Image-Based Growth: What if the generator used one of your portraits or photographs as an invisible blueprint?
You'd load an image in the background.
The rules of the walkers would change based on the pixels underneath them. For example:
Density: The chance to spawn a new branch could be much higher in the darker areas of the image. This would cause the lines to cluster in the shadows of a portrait, effectively "drawing" the form with a network of branches.
Color Sampling: The color of the line and its glow could be directly sampled from the color of the pixel it's currently on.
Boundaries: The lines could be programmed to stop when they hit very bright areas, creating voids and highlights.
